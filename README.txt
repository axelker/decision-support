# Overview
This project is a decision-support software designed to solve complex problems by applying various algorithms. The software includes modules for constraint solving, task planning, and data mining, providing optimal solutions across different contexts, such as project planning, logistics, and more.

## Key Features
- Constraint Solvers: Implements algorithms like AC-3 (Arc Consistency 3), MAC (Maintaining Arc Consistency), and backtracking to handle constraint satisfaction problems.
- Planners: Uses search algorithms such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* for effective pathfinding and task planning.
- Data Mining Techniques: Includes algorithms for pattern recognition, such as brute force rules and association rules, to analyze and extract insights from datasets.

## Project Structure
- build/: Directory containing compiled .class files.
- src/: Contains all source code, organized into packages and classes.
- compilation.sh: A shell script to compile and run the program.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A Unix-based terminal or compatible environment


### Compilation and Execution
Open a terminal and run compilation.sh.
